NOKIA5110 is a simple C library for working with the Nokia 84x48 LCD display
when connected to the SPI bus.
The idea is to provide a simple interface for C programmers to make use of 
those low-cost LCD displays without having to read the data sheet or figure
out SPI programming. Unfortunately the display controller needs a couple of
control lines (GPIO pins) for Reset and Data/Command; this requires using
an external library (wiringPi) to make it work.

To build the library, simply type 'make' in the terminal. To build the sample
app, type 'make -f make_sample'. This will build the n5110 executable to show
that the library is working.
