NOKIA5110 is a simple C library for working with the Nokia 84x48 LCD display
when connected to the SPI bus.
The idea is to provide a simple interface for C programmers to make use of 
those low-cost LCD displays without having to read the data sheet or figure
out SPI programming. Unfortunately the display controller needs a couple of
control lines (GPIO pins) for Reset and Data/Command; this requires using
an external library (wiringPi) to make it work.

To build the library, simply type 'make' in the terminal. To build the sample
app, type 'make -f make_sample'. This will build the n5110 executable to show
that the library is working.

Troubleshooting tips:

1) Make sure to enable the SPI interface in raspi-config
2) Connect the "CE" pin of the 5110 to the CE0 or CE1 pin on the RPi header.
   If connected to CE0, initialize the SPIChannel to 0, if CE1, use ch 1.
3) You can use any GPIO pins to control the D/C,RST/LED lines; initialize the
   5110 library with the pin numbers used (not GPIO numbers)
4) The header pin-to-GPIO conversion table I use only supports RPi boards with
   40 pin headers. Any older boards (e.g. original RPi-B) will not necessarily
   work.
